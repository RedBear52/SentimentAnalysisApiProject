# Natural Language Processing API - Article Evaluation Project

# Project Explanation
This is a basic web application that prompts the user to input the url address of a webpage.

Upon receiving the user-inputted web address, the application returns a 'sentiment analysis' of the submitted content to the UI.

The sentiment analysis is made possible through use of a [Meaning Cloud API](https://www.meaningcloud.com).

In this project, we utilize the text analysis tool's advanced natural language processing to determine whether the user-submitted content is positive, neutral, or negative and also to evaluate whether the overall sentiment is objective or subjective.

# Installation
[(Back to Table of Contents)](#table-of-contents)
To run this web app, you'll need to have node/npm installed and a rudimentary understanding of git.

First clone the repo via the CLI with the following command:

`git init`

`git clone https://github.com/RedBear52/SentimentAnalysisApiProject.git`

Then, `cd` into the cloned project directory and run `npm run start`.
This will start run the server at http://localhost:3000

# Sandbox
If you'd like to experiment with this app for educational/evaluative purposes, you may want to run the webpack-dev-server via the `npm run build-dev` command.
This will run a live, reloading dev server tool that makes for a better dev experience when tweaking, testing and experimenting with the code.

# Usage
[(Back to Table of Contents)](#table-of-contents)
Best used as a learning tool to practice and improve your own understanding of the above-mentioned web technologies and how they typically function within a project.
